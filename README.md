# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. In this project i create a landing page for a coffeeshop, I've created 7 sections total to make it complete. It is my first time creating a form from scratch for setting up a reservation, similar to what restaurants have on thier websites. Aditionally, I've had my firs ttime creating animations as well, I created a pulsating animation for my about section.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future I want to add functionality to the nav links and add more anitmations to the page as well, giving it more interactivity and style...
